<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
My name is Htet Wai Yan. I am a rising senior at Purdue Unversity majoring in Electrical Engineering. My area of interest is in VLSI. I still haven't decided which avenue but I am looking into areas of System On Chip, Design Automation, Memory Architectures and Computer Architecutures. I am part of the SoCET CSME MRAM team and I have experience in working with parralel interface MRAM. Outside of academia my interest are playing Pokemon VGC and reading Warhammer 40K lore. If you are fellow Pokemon VGC enthusiast than head over and see what teams I am running and feel free to send me a paste of your teams.
